2. **Information Cards**: Mental health tips and common issues presented through Bootstrap’s card components. This layout makes the information visually appealing and easy to digest.

Users will find valuable tips, resources, and affirmations that promote well-being in a simple, visually clean design. The design aims to reduce user stress and provide a sense of support, whether users are browsing on desktop or mobile.

## Key Decisions & AI Contribution:
AI played a key role in:
- **Identifying and Resolving Bugs**: AI helped identify potential issues with layout consistency between desktop and mobile views and assisted in resolving responsiveness issues using Bootstrap’s grid system and text utilities.
- **Performance & UX Improvements**: The AI contributed to the design by recommending color palettes and layout enhancements to optimize the calming and supportive aesthetic of the site, ensuring a pleasant user experience.
- **Code Generation**: The initial HTML and CSS framework was generated using AI, streamlining the development process, and significantly reducing coding time.
